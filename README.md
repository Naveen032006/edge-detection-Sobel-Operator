# Sobel Operator for Edge Detection ðŸŽ¥

This repository contains a **video explanation** of the **Sobel Operator** used for edge detection in image processing.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Sobel Operator is a widely used method in computer vision to detect edges by calculating the gradient of pixel intensities in an image. This video explains:

- The concept of edge detection
- How the Sobel operator works (Sobel X and Y kernels)
- A step-by-step **numerical example**
- Visual intuition behind gradient-based edge detection
